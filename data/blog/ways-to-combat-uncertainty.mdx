About a year ago, [Jamie Dimon did an interview on “60 Minutes](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jamie-dimon-jp-morgan-chase-ceo-the-60-minutes-interview-2019-11-10/),” in which the interviewer asked Dimon about the unpredictability in the economy right now and whether it was more so than usual. Dimon’s response was, “No. If you look at history, if you take a newspaper and open it at any month of any year, you’d have the same list of hugely unpredictable things.”

## Looking at History

Since then, we have had a world-changing pandemic and an economic crisis. Even considering these circumstances, I would still agree with Jamie Dimon that there is always uncertainty. Looking at old newspapers is incredibly helpful in gaining insight into what people were thinking at that moment. What I found was that they were consumed with the same uncertainty we are feeling today. Mark Twain famously said that while history doesn’t repeat itself, it does rhyme. A while ago, I discovered that the _New York Times_ website has a feature called [Time Machine](https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/browser). This service allows you to look back at 150 years of their newspaper. It is incredible to see their first newspaper from September 18, 1851; reading the articles is like stepping back in time and seeing history through their eyes. Newspapers provide a perspective that history books cannot: how people felt at that moment in time. You can look at several articles during a recession or an event that significantly affected the economy and see how people reacted before and after.

## Timing is a Fools Game

It is nearly impossible to predict a recession, but that doesn’t stop anyone from trying to do just that. The result is often that more money is lost in waiting and trying to time the market. Things are much more complicated than we think and can stay irrational for a long time. I believe that the stock market’s constant action is not helpful to many investors because it is not a perfect reflection of the underlying economy. The human emotions involved in the stock market drive the peaks and valleys, while the reality is probably much smoother. I recently read a book about [Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies](https://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Solved-Market-Revolution/dp/073521798X), a famous quantitative hedge fund manager who questioned whether to pull money out of the market during the correction in late 2018. It’s amazing that a man who conquered the market for over 30 years still is unable to keep his emotions from clouding his judgment.

## The Risk Is Not Volatility - It’s You

Volatility is not risk; your approach to it is the real risk. The stock market is a complex system with so many inputs that it is almost impossible to predict in the short term. Benjamin Graham had a great quote: “Short run, the market is like a voting machine – tallying up which firms are popular and unpopular. But in the long run, the market is like a weighing machine.” Buyers of private companies and real estate experience much less volatility because these investments don’t have real-time prices, and it is harder to buy/sell. Having options is incredibly valuable, but when looking at investments, this flexibility can complicate things. Getting real-time pricing from the stock market can wreak havoc on an investor’s emotions.  When you can’t keep emotions in check, investors tend to sell low and buy high.  It is easy to quote Buffett, “Buy when there’s blood in the streets, even if the blood is your own.”  It is another thing to actually do it.  I have found a few solutions to this issue:

1. Have a long-term perspective.
2. Invest in high-quality companies.
3. Avoid debt.

## Compounding is the Key

The goal of investing is to let your investments compound over a long time. If we look at history, we can see that the economy has always hit rough patches and that during these times, investors need to make sure they stay in the game. Compounding is key to wealth creation, and it does not need outstanding returns but good return over a long period of time.  Morgan Housel has a great example in is [recent book](https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Money-Timeless-lessons-happiness/dp/0857197681) comparing Jim Simons and Warren Buffett. Jim Simons produced 66% returns for the past 30 years, while Buffett had roughly 20% returns over 50 years. Although Buffett has seemingly inferior returns, his net worth is roughly two to three times greater than Simons. How? Compounding, which takes time. Buffett had a 20-year head start.

## America’s Tailwind

While uncertainty is a constant in the short term, there’s one thing that’s not uncertain: America has incredible tailwinds. Buffett’s 2019 annual letter shows how US tailwinds have been powering the economy, and he walks through the reasons why he remains bullish on the US economy. I agree with his analysis. Let’s put numbers to that claim: if when I was born in 1980, \$1,000 had been invested in a no-fee S&P 500 index fund and all dividends had been reinvested, my stake would have grown to be worth \$74,378 (pre-taxes) on 8/31/2020. Let’s say I got nervous and decided to cash out after the great recession and subsequent recovery in 2011; then I would have only \$21,639, a difference of 240%. Compounding is a powerful force!
